🪟 Windows 11 UI Clone (Built from Scratch)

"Thought it was a real Windows 11 screen? Nah bro, I built the whole UI from scratch using code only!" 😎

This is a fully responsive Windows 11 UI clone made purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no design tools, no screenshots, just 100% code! It replicates the smooth modern look of Windows 11 with a functional start menu, taskbar, and interactive UI elements.
